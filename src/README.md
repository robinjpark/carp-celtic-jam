# Contents

The directory contains the content of the carp celtic jam tunebook, which consists of:
1. carp-celtic-jam.abc  This contains the tunes in abc format, as well as
some title pages.
1. change-log.docx  A change log suitable for publication to the general public.
1. cover-page.pdf
1. acknowledgements.tex

Note that the index is NOT here.  There is no need to manually update the index.  Building the project automatically re-generates the index from the abc source and adds it to both the printable and tablet-friendly publishable versions of the tune book.

* Do not forget to update the change log when updating the abc file! *
