# carp-celtic-jam
This repository contains the book of tunes for the Carp Celtic Jam.

This repository contains the complete tunebook in .abc format, and instructions and tools for converting the tunes into useful .pdf files for printing or for reading music on a tablet.

Those files can them be uploaded onto the Carp Celtic Jam's website for public
access.  The public website is at https://carpcelticjam.wixsite/carpjam

Actually, the website's "Tune Book" link is actually a link to a DropBox folder
containing the complete tunel book.
